            I am a Japanese-American international student currently attending university in Canada. 
            I major in Geography and Computer Science as ways for me to make sense of my experiences and to
            grasp at an understanding of the complex world we live in. Through studying geography I have 
            developed a macro-perspective on a variety of subjects in the context of space and time. 
            Subjects include history, politics, economics, climate change, sustainability and public health, 
            centered around urban environments and globalisation. 
            <br></br>
            In combinitation with Computer Science, the subject has changed my understanding of
            technology and the impact it has on a global scale. Through individualized data, we increasingly
            develop accurate models for social interaction, the built environment and the natural environment.
            With computers becoming embedded in our everyday interactions with objects, the data we collect from
            them will only further this process in developing accurate models for the world we live in. 
            <br></br>
            In the context of cities and urban spaces, embedded computing integrated within the built environment will collect our data
            on a much larger scale. This is a fundamental milestone in human history as what we base our decision making from will most
            likely be changed forever. With the availability of relatively objective personal information, the relational concept of
            knowledge and power continues to exist. Digital information has provided a way to represent and store individualized choices
            and behavior through our interaction with the digital space. This representation of information is directly tied to power.  
            Digital information has the ability to vastly improve the conditions, functions and structure of human society by providing
            a more objective view of the world, however, at the same time pushes us towards a surveillance based state, radically changing our behavior.
            The use of this information with self-focused and destructive intentions could also be the detriment of humankind.
            <br></br>
            I am deeply interested in the future of technology, as it provides a glimpse into what the future may hold. I am interested in
            Smart Cities and IoT technologies because I choose to believe the former of this argument, that technology will move us towards
            a society that is supportive, reliable, consistent and truly enjoyable for all individuals. Whether or not this will be realized
            in my life time is not the focus, however, it is the motivation for my interests in this growing space and I want to make
            positive contributions to its development.
